			- Lazy Loading
			- Generate Components
			- Services
			
=> Generate a module "contacts"
		use the command ng g modules contacts --routing.
		
=> Made an entry in routes app.routing.ts
			Like this:  
		{
        path: 'contact',
        loadChildren: () =>import('./contacts/contacts.module').then(m => m.ContactsModule)
		}

=> Generated our components.
		 - list 
		 - create
		 - delete
		 - edit
		 - search
		 
=> We added routes in teh contact modules for child routes
		like this-
				{
					path: '',
					children: [
					  { path: '', component: ListComponent},
					  { path: 'create', component: CreateComponent},
					  { path: 'edit', component: EditComponent},
					  { path: 'delete', component:EditComponent},
					  { path: 'search', component:SearchComponent}
					]
				}
				
=> we will make that routes availble in contact list component.
